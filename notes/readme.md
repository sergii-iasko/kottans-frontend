## Git and GitHub

<details><summary>Notes</summary>


Before git there were commands in Linux to use for updating the code.
`diff` and `diff -u` to make file with changes between files
`patch` to grab changes in diff file to adjusted one.
Example:
```
diff -u file1.py file2.py > file.diff

patch file1.py < file.diff
```

How to set e-mail address - [**Setting your email in Git**](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/)

_.gitignore_ file is used to exlude certain types of files we don't want to commit<br>
Example of added types in _.gitignore_:
```
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*._*
*.zip
```

*HEAD* represent the current checked-out snapshot of the commit.<br>
Can be imaged as a bookmark or a pointer to certain commit.

`git log -p` represents the same as `diff -u`

`git log -2` represpent last 2 commits, can be any number

`git show [id]` show log info for a certain commit

`git checkout [filename]` reverts file not staged yet to the latest commit

`git reset HEAD [file]` remove files from staged area

`git commit --ammend` changing previous commit. ***Use only for local commits***.

`git revert HEAD` adds a new commit which rollsback the previous one

`git revert [hash]` adds a new commit which rollsback the commit wih ID stated

_*Branch*_ - a pointer to a particular commit. Rather can be thougt as a separate place to do the work.

`git branch` shows list of branches

`git branch [name]` creates a new branch

`git checkout [branch]` switch to different branch

`git checkout -b [branch name]` create new branch and switch there immediately

`git branch -d [name]` delete branch

`git branch -D [name] delete branch even if it has uncommited changes

`git merge [name]` adds changes from branch into currently checked out.

`git log --graph --oneline` visual way of presenting the merging history

`git merge --abort` If there are merge conflicts (meaning files are incompatible), --abort can be used to abort the merge action.

`git rebase [target branch]` copy and moves to another branch not merging, leaving previous branch as is

`git checkout HEAD^` checkout to commit 1 step above HEAD (^2 - 2 steps)

`git branch -f [name] [hash]` move branch to certain commit

`git clone [url]`copy repo to local from gitHub

`git push` upload repo to remote

`git pull`download from remote

`git remote` list of remote repos

`git remote -v`

`git remote show [name]`describes remote repo

`git remote update`fetches latest updates

`git fetch` download specific objects

`git branch -r` lists remote branches

`git rebase [name]` puts a branch on top of other branch

`git rebase -i [pointer]` lets choose which commit and in which to rebase (unlike cherry-pick gives a list of hashes)

`git cherry-pick [pointer]` choose and rebase commits by hashes
